Sentiment Analysis model, using NLTK, for cleaning the input, and Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm, for sentiment score generation, which returns ‘Positive’, ‘Negative’ or ‘Neutral’, depending upon the inputted paragraph. It has been tested to have an accuracy of 86%.

Cleaned the input paragraph text using NLTK module, so as to remove the unnecessary phrases and vectorized it to make it computer-understandable.  Research was done on various suitable algorithms suitable for sentiment detection.  Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes were found to be the best. The cleaned text was passed into an instance of Multinomial Naïve Bayes, to get the sentiment score. Faced a few issues executing the plan, initially, but I did overcome them, eventually.

By applying the above algorithm, the generated model yields 86% accurate output.
